Constructors
      //Constructors are special methods invoked when an object is created and are used to initialize them.
      /*A constructor can be used to provide initial values for object attributes.
        - A constructor name must be same as its class name.
        - A constructor must have no explicit return type.*/

      //Example of a constructor:
public class Vehicle {
  private String color;
  Vehicle() {
     color = "Red";
  }
}

      //The Vehicle() method is the constructor of our class, 
      //so whenever an object of that class is created, the color attribute will be set to "Red".
      //A constructor can also take parameters to initialize attributes.
public class Vehicle {
  private String color;
  Vehicle(String c) {
    color = c;
  }
}

      //You can think of constructors as methods that will set up your class by default, so you donâ€™t need to repeat the same code every time.
 
      //to create a valid constructor
class Person {
   private int age;
   public Person(int myage) {
      age = myage;
   }
}


Using Constructors
      //The constructor is called when you create an object using the new keyword.

      //Example:
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    Vehicle v = new Vehicle("Blue");
  }
}

      //This will call the constructor, which will set the color attribute to "Blue".
      //The constructor must have the same name as the class. 
      

      //A single class can have multiple constructors with different numbers of parameters.
      //The setter methods inside the constructors can be used to set the attribute values.

      //Example:
public class Vehicle {
  private String color;

  Vehicle() {
    this.setColor("Red");
  }
  Vehicle(String c) {
    this.setColor(c);
  }

  // Setter
  public void setColor(String c) {
    this.color = c;
  }
}

      //The class above has two constructors, one without any parameters setting the color attribute to a default value of "Red", 
      //and another constructor that accepts a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

      //Now, we can use the constructors to create objects of our class.
public class Vehicle {
    private String color;
    
    Vehicle() {
        this.setColor("Red");
    }
    Vehicle(String c) {
        this.setColor(c);
    }
    
    // Setter
    public void setColor(String c) {
        this.color = c;
    }
    
    // Getter
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }
}

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        //color will be "Red"
        Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
        
        //color will be "Green"
        Vehicle v2 = new Vehicle("Green"); 
        
        System.out.println(v2.getColor());
    }
}     //output: Green

      //Java automatically provides a default constructor, so all classes have a constructor, whether one is specifically defined or not.


      //Example:
class A {       //First you need to define A, in this case class. 
  private int x;    //Then since there is a private variable called x, we need to define another variable that links to x.
   public A(int val) {      //If x is integer, then val is also int.
     x = val;
   }
}
