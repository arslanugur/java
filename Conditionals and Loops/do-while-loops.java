do...while Loops
        //A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

        //Notice that the condition appears at the end of the loop, so the statements in the loop execute once before it is tested.
        //Even with a false condition, the code will run once.

        //How is a do while loop different from a while loop?
        //A do while loop runs your code at least one time.


Loop Control Statements
        //The break and continue statements change the loop's execution flow.
        //The break statement terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.

        //The continue statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and then immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. 
        //In other words, it makes the loop skip to its next iteration.
